{"name":"Accessibility Bookmarklets","tagline":"Highlight accessibility features of web pages","body":"# bookmarklets\r\n\r\nHighlight classes of elements on a web page that relate to accessibility\r\nrequirements, including:\r\n\r\n* Forms\r\n* Headings\r\n* Landmarks\r\n\r\nInstructions for using the web accessibility bookmarklets:\r\n\r\n* An outlined area (e.g., a heading outline with label 'h2') is referred\r\n  to as an overlay. It has the same geometry as the element it outlines.\r\n* Hovering over the label of an overlay (the solid-color rectangle in the\r\n  top-right corner) will display a tooltip with information on the\r\n  underlying element's type, label, text content or accessible name.\r\n* You can move an overlay with mouse drag-and-drop using its label as the\r\n  drag handle.\r\n* After moving an overlay, double clicking its label will move the overlay\r\n  back to its original position.\r\n* The last overlay that was clicked or moved has the highest z-index of all\r\n  overlays. Thus if the label of one overlay is partially obscured by the\r\n  label of another, clicking the partially obscured label will expose the\r\n  entire label.\r\n* In some cases, one overlay may completely obscure another, hiding even\r\n  the label of the other overlay. We plan to address this issue by adding\r\n  page-level information that indicates how many overlays of each type\r\n  were found on the page.\r\n\r\nNote: A bookmarklet is a JavaScript snippet that can be run within a web\r\nbrowser and that typically performs an action related to the currently\r\nloaded web page.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
